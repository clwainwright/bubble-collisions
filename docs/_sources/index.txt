Welcome to the bubble_collisions documentation!
===============================================

The ``bubble_collisions`` package contains (or will contain) everything needed to simulate and analyze collisions between bubble universes in an eternal inflation framework. The core code is written in C with a Python interface, and there are several additional Python scripts for analysis.

The original code was described in `arXiv:1312.1357`_, and later used in `arXiv:1407.2950`_.

Note that in some places I use *N* to indicate the time variable, which matches the notation in the papers, and in some places I use *t*, which is much less ambiguous. The *N* variable can also refer to the relative time step in a simulation region (:math:`\Delta t \propto 2^N`).
