"""
The primary task of the generic_potential module is to define the 
:class:`generic_potential` class, from which realistic scalar field models can
straightforwardly be constructed. The most important part of any such model is,
appropiately, the potential function and its gradient. This module is not
necessary to define a potential, but it does make the process somewhat simpler
by automatically calculating one-loop effects from a model-specific mass
spectrum, constructing numerical derivative functions, providing a 
simplified interface to the :mod:`transitionFinder` module, and providing
several methods for plotting the potential and its phases.

class generic_potential():
    """
    An abstract class from which one can easily create finite-temperature
    effective potentials.
    
    This class acts as the skeleton around which different scalar field models
    can be formed. At a bare minimum, subclasses must implement :func:`init`,
    :func:`V0`, and :func:`boson_massSq`. Subclasses will also likely implement
    :func:`fermion_massSq` and :func:`approxZeroTMin`. Once the tree-level 
    potential and particle spectrum are defined, the one-loop zero-temperature
    potential (using MS-bar renormalization) and finite-temperature potential
    can be used without any further modification.

    If one wishes to rewrite the effective potential from scratch (that is,
    using a different method to calculate one-loop and finite-temperature
    corrections), this class and its various helper functions can still be used.
    In that case, one would need to override :func:`Vtot` (used by most of the
    helper functions) and :func:`V1T_from_X` (which should only return the 
    temperature-dependent part of Vtot; used in temperature derivative
    calculations), and possibly override :func:`V0` (used by
    :func:`massSqMatrix` and for plotting at tree level).
    
    The `__init__` function performs initialization specific for this abstract
    class. Subclasses should either override this initialization *but make sure
    to call the parent implementation*, or, more simply, override the
    :func:`init` method. In the base implementation, the former calls the latter
    and the latter does nothing. At a bare minimum, subclasses must set the
    `Ndim` parameter to the number of dynamic field dimensions in the model. 
    
    One of the main jobs of this class is to provide an easy interface for
    calculating the phase structure and phase transitions. These are given by
    the methods :func:`getPhases`, :func:`calcTcTrans`, and 
    :func:`findAllTransitions`.

    The following attributes can (and should!) be set during initialiation:
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    Ndim : int
        The number of dynamic field dimensions in the model. This *must* be
        overridden by subclasses during initialization.
    x_eps : float
        The epsilon to use in brute-force evalutations of the gradient and
        for the second derivatives. May be overridden by subclasses; 
        defaults to 0.001.
    T_eps : float
        The epsilon to use in brute-force evalutations of the temperature 
        derivative. May be overridden by subclasses; defaults to 0.001.
    deriv_order : int
        Sets the order to which finite difference derivatives are calculated.
        Must be 2 or 4. May be overridden by subclasses; defaults to 4.
    renormScaleSq : float
        The square of the renormalization scale to use in the MS-bar one-loop 
        zero-temp potential. May be overridden by subclasses; 
        defaults to 1000.0**2.
    Tmax : float
        The maximum temperature to which minima should be followed. No
        transitions are calculated above this temperature. This is also used
        as the overall temperature scale in :func:`getPhases`.
        May be overridden by subclasses; defaults to 1000.0.
    num_boson_dof : int or None
        Total number of bosonic degrees of freedom, including radiation.
        This is used to add a field-independent but temperature-dependent 
        contribution to the effective potential. It does not affect the relative
        pressure or energy density between phases, so it does not affect the
        critical or nucleation temperatures. If None, the total number of
        degrees of freedom will be taken directly from :meth:`boson_massSq`.
    num_fermion_dof : int or None
        Total number of fermionic degrees of freedom, including radiation.
        If None, the total number of degrees of freedom will be taken 
        directly from :meth:`fermion_massSq`.

        The name "forbidPhaseCrit" is supposed to be short for "critera for
        forbidding a phase". Apologies for the name mangling; I'm not sure why
        I originally decided to leave off the "eria" in "criteria", but I should
        leave it as is for easier backwards compatability.
